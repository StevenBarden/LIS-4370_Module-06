# LIS-4370-Module-06
This project, part of the LIS-4370 course at the University of South Florida, focuses on matrix operations and manipulations in R. The goal is to demonstrate fundamental linear algebra concepts through practical implementation using R's built-in matrix capabilities.

## Project Overview
The project implements three key matrix operations:
1. Matrix addition and subtraction using predefined 2x2 matrices
2. Generation of a 4x4 diagonal matrix with specified values
3. Creation of a custom 5x5 matrix with a specific pattern

## Implementation Results

### 1. Matrix Addition/Subtraction Operations
Matrix operations performed on 2x2 matrices A and B:

Addition Result (A + B):
    [,1] [,2]
[1,]    7    5
[2,]    2    2

Subtraction Result (A - B):
    [,1] [,2]
[1,]   -3   -3
[2,]   -2    4

### 2. Diagonal Matrix Generation
4x4 diagonal matrix with specified values:

    [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    4    0    0    0
[2,]    0    1    0    0
[3,]    0    0    2    0
[4,]    0    0    0    3

### 3. Custom Matrix Pattern
5x5 matrix demonstrating specific element placement:

    [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    3    1    1    1    1
[2,]    2    3    0    0    0
[3,]    2    0    3    0    0
[4,]    2    0    0    3    0
[5,]    2    0    0    0    3

## Methodology
